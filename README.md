GEneral Notes ::

Variable scope : where a variable is accessible.

let = variables are limited to block scope {}
var = variables are limited to function(){} scope. It can escape parenthesis() but not the curly braces;

Global variable is declared outside any function.
If global, var will UN-INTENTIONALLY CHANGE browser's window properties.
